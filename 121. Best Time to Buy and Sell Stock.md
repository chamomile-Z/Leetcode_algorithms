# My Solution 
```Python
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # if only one record in prices, no transaction, return profit = 0
        if len(prices) == 0 or len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        
        # if there are multiple records, then 
        # initialize two pointers, one is the buy time, one is sell time; create an empty list to store profit for each possible transaction
        buy = 0
        sell = 1
        profits = []
        
        for r in range(1, len(prices)):
            # if current price is smaller than buy time's price, change buy time as current time
            if prices[buy] >= prices[r]:
                buy = r
            # if current price is larger than buy time's price, change sell time as current time
            else:
                # if sell time is larger than buy time, this is one transaction, store in profits
                sell = r
                if buy < sell:
                    profits.append(prices[sell] - prices[buy])
        
        if len(profits) == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return max(profits)
```

# My Solution (Improving)
```Python
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # if only one record in prices, no transaction, return profit = 0
        if len(prices) == 0 or len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        
        # if there are multiple records, then 
        # initialize two pointers, one is the buy time, one is sell time; create an empty list to store profit for each possible transaction
        buy = 0
        sell = 1
        profit = 0
        
        for r in range(1, len(prices)):
            # if current price is smaller than buy time's price, change buy time as current time
            if prices[buy] >= prices[r]:
                buy = r
            # if current price is larger than buy time's price, change sell time as current time
            else:
                # if sell time is larger than buy time, this is one transaction, store in profits
                sell = r
                if buy < sell:
                    profit = max(profit, prices[sell] - prices[buy])
        return profit
