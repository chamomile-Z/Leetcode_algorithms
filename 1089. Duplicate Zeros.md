```

## Summary
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) - the time complexity of insert is O(n), pop is O(1) and there is one for loop O(n)  
- Space Complexity: O(1) - do the above modification in place

## Summary
- Time Complexity: O(n) - do two passes through the array, one to find the number of possible_dups, and the other to copy the elements.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
