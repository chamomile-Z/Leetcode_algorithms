# My Solution
```Python
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        word_s = {}
        word_t = {}
        
        for i in s:
            if i in word_s:
                word_s[i] += 1
            else:
                word_s[i] = 1
        
        for j in t:
            if j in word_t:
                word_t[j] += 1
            else:
                word_t[j] = 1
                
        return word_t == word_s
```

## Method
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1) (Notice: no matter how long the word is, there are only 26 characters, so the size of space is constant)
