### My solution
```Python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # judge if the length is zero, if true, directly return 1
        if len(digits) == 0:
            return 1
        
        # initialize 
        l = len(digits)
        n = 0
        
        # converse the list of digits to integer:
        for ind, d in enumerate(digits):
            n += d * (10 ** (l-1-ind))
        
        # plus one to the integer and converse again to list
        newn = n + 1
        plusone = [int(d) for d in str(newn)]
        
        # in case the leading elements are zero, adding the judgement and completion
        newl = len(plusone)
        if newl < l:
            plusone = digits[:(l - newl)] + plusone
        
        return plusone
```

Comment: this solution combines mathematics method and converting from list, string to number or number to string, list. However this is not an effective method to solve since
the speeding time is slow for "plusone = digits[:(l - newl)] + plusone" (this part, "+" for list, actually is not efficient way to do)


### Learning Part
"Plus one" is a subset of the problem set of "Add Number", which shares the same solution pattern.  
All these problems could be solved in linear time, and the question here is how to solve it without using the addition operation or how to solve it in constant space complexity.   
The choice of algorithm should be based on the format of input. Here we list a few examples:
- Integers  
Usually the addition operation is not allowed for such a case. Use Bit Manipulation Approach. Here is an example: Add Binary.  
- Strings
Use bit by bit computation. Note, sometimes it might not be feasible to come up a solution with the constant space for languages with immutable strings.
- Linked Lists
Sentinel Head + Schoolbook Addition with Carry. Here is an example: Plus One Linked List.  
- Arrays (also the current problem)
Schoolbook addition with carry.

```diff
- Note that, a straightforward idea to convert everything into integers and then apply the addition could be risky, especially for the implementation in Java, due to the potential integer overflow issue.
