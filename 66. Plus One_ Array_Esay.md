### My solution
```Python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # judge if the length is zero, if true, directly return 1
        if len(digits) == 0:
            return 1
        
        # initialize 
        l = len(digits)
        n = 0
        
        # converse the list of digits to integer:
        for ind, d in enumerate(digits):
            n += d * (10 ** (l-1-ind))
        
        # plus one to the integer and converse again to list
        newn = n + 1
        plusone = [int(d) for d in str(newn)]
        
        # in case the leading elements are zero, adding the judgement and completion
        newl = len(plusone)
        if newl < l:
            plusone = digits[:(l - newl)] + plusone
        
        return plusone
```

Comment: this solution combines mathematics method and converting from list, string to number or number to string, list. However this is not an effective method to solve since
the speeding time is slow for "plusone = digits[:(l - newl)] + plusone" (this part, "+" for list, actually is not efficient way to do)
