# My Solution (One Pass)
```Python
  def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    counter = 0
    maxcounter = 0
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
      if nums[i] == 1:
        counter += 1
        maxcounter = max(counter, maxcounter)
      else:
        counter = 0
        
    return maxcounter
```

## Method
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
