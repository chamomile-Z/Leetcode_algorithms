# My Solution
```Python
    def shortestDistance(self, words: List[str], word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        word1_ind = inf
        word2_ind = inf
        d = inf
        
        for ind, word in enumerate(words):
            if word == word1:
                word1_ind = ind
            if word == word2:
                word2_ind = ind
            d = min(d, abs(word1_ind - word2_ind))
       
        return d
```
